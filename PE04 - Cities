During this week PE04, I have learned about routing. I have created multiple components in city Application. The basic concept of the application that a react application that take user input of city, county, and population which I have rendered into the listing page where I have configured the user input City as a link. This Link has child details where we can see more details like county and population. However, I have used Navigation bar on the screen first and make it static so we can see it through out the pages. I have used MUI library along with custom CSS files. Furthermore, I have added buttons for each page where we can see the details without routing.
Routing is not much challenging as much as mapping the list. I created files like App.js, Home.js, CitiesList.js, addCity.js and cityDetails.js. Here, each file has certain implementations the create a simple react Application.
