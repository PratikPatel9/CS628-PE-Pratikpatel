During this PE, I have simply create a new app that  contain new component "Resume" using "npx-create-react-app" command.
it generates new application along with necessary dependencies and skaletop of the project.
Also, it has basic react app.
secondly, i have used "npm install" command to generate node Modules that contains node dependecies.
i have started rendering the application on local host :port 3000 using command " npm start".
After rendering the react app. i removed some unnecessary code from App.js file.
i have genrated a component that is "resume"
i have called that "resume" component to the app.js file using "<Resume/>".
I have added the code in resume.js file which used "HTML code using individual Div tags.
i have created "Resume.css" file which provides useful styling for my resume.
